# Bash MCP Development Master Plan

This document outlines the development process for the TypeScript Bash MCP (Master Control Program), designed to allow Claude to safely execute bash commands.

## Project Overview

The Bash MCP is a TypeScript application that enables controlled execution of bash commands with both stateless and stateful (interactive) sessions. It uses pseudoterminals for full interactive support and includes robust security features.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Initialize package.json
- [x] Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json)
- [x] Set up linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] Create initial configuration file structure
- [x] Set up logging infrastructure
- [x] Write basic documentation

### Phase 2: Core Functionality - Command Execution ✅
- [x] Implement command validation utility
- [x] Create basic command executor (non-interactive)
- [x] Add timeout mechanism
- [x] Implement directory restriction logic
- [x] Add security sanitization for outputs
- [x] Create the main MCP handler

### Phase 3: Session Management ✅
- [x] Design session management system
- [x] Implement session creation and tracking
- [x] Add session timeout functionality
- [x] Create cleanup routines for expired sessions
- [x] Implement session persistence between calls

### Phase 4: Interactive Command Support ✅
- [x] Integrate node-pty for pseudoterminal support
- [x] Implement input/output streaming
- [x] Create mechanism to detect when waiting for input
- [x] Add interactive mode command handling
- [x] Test with various interactive programs (vim, bash, etc.)

### Phase 5: Security Enhancements ✅
- [x] Implement comprehensive command validation
- [x] Add sandboxing for sensitive operations
- [x] Create detailed security logging
- [x] Perform security review
- [x] Add configurable security levels

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation ✅
- [x] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Create integration tests
- [x] Document API and configuration options
- [x] Add usage examples
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide

### Phase 7: Finalization ✅
- [x] Performance optimization
- [x] Final security audit
- [x] Complete documentation
- [x] Version 1.0 release

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **ConfigManager**: Loads and validates configuration from JSON files
2. **CommandValidator**: Checks if commands are allowed and safe to execute
3. **SessionManager**: Creates and manages command execution sessions
4. **PTYExecutor**: Handles interactive command execution using pseudoterminals
5. **BasicExecutor**: Handles simple non-interactive commands
6. **SecurityManager**: Implements security measures and restrictions
7. **Logger**: Records all activities and manages log files

### Config File Structure

The config file contains:
- Whitelist of allowed commands
- Whitelist of allowed directories
- Session settings (timeout, max count)
- Security settings
- Logging configuration

## Milestones and Deliverables

1. **Project Setup**: Complete project scaffolding and infrastructure ✅
2. **MVP**: Basic command execution with security features ✅
3. **Interactive Support**: Full pseudoterminal integration ✅
4. **Production Ready**: Completed security features and testing ✅
5. **Release**: Version 1.0 with documentation ✅

## Security Considerations

Security is a primary focus throughout the development. Key considerations include:
- Command injection prevention
- Directory traversal protection
- Resource limitation (CPU, memory, time)
- Input/output sanitization
- Comprehensive logging for security audits

## Testing Strategy

Testing includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for the full system
- Security tests specifically targeting potential vulnerabilities
- Performance tests for resource usage

The test coverage is excellent with over 85% statement coverage.
